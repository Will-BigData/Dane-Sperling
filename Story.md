You wake up in the middle of the woods
There are 3 paths
One path seems like a trail, one path goes right and looks old, the last path would take you through the brush
What do you do?
1: Take the trail path
2: Go right on the old path
3: Go through the brush
type in Quit at any time to stop.

Down the trailed path you are safe, for now
You walk for what feels like miles
You finally come accross something man made
A cabin in the woods
What do you do?
1: Call out for anyone there
2: Enter the cabin
3: Continue down the path

You go right onto the old path
Going down it you feel a sense of dread
Each step you lose a little bit of yourself
Without realizing it you notice you have not moved for what feels like minutes
You hear footsteps behind you
What do you do?
1: Turn Around
2: Run Away
3: Plead for mercy

You go through the brush
Pretty soon you feel as though you made a mistake
Moving through the brush gets harder and harder as you go
With each step you get more fatigued
Finally you reach a chainlink fence on the outskirts of the woods
Past the fence is a clearing and what you think is a gravel road
What do you do?
1: Climb over the fence
2: Walk along the fence line
3: Wait to see if any cars drive by

You cry out for anyone
Any sign of life
You don't hear back
You continue to cry out for what seems like hours
Seemingly unable to move
Looking onto the cabin you feel a sense of dread, almost like you shouldn't be here
The sun is going down, you cannot afford to be unsheltered
Upon going inside it is too dark to see anything but you make it to a bedroom
What do you do?
1: Go to sleep
2: Try to stay awake
3: Try to start a fire in the fireplace

Upon entering the cabin you see an abandoned home in need of repair
You also find a map of the surrounding area
You start a fire easily with a fire starter and some spare lumber you find next to the fireplace
There is not much in the kitchen for food but you do find some canned food to heat up
Upon eating you look upon the map more you notice a lake that has an outlet to a river
If you make it to a dock on that lake and find a boat
That would be the quickest way out
You now have a plan to leave, it is easy with the map to find your way to the lake
Upon getting to the dock you find a old motor boat
You pull the chord on the engine and hear the engine rumble, you can get out of here
According to the map there are 3 channels this river flows into
All of them would get you out of this forest
Which do you choose?
1: Right channel, it looks calm
2: Middle channel, it looks loaded with brush, it might take you longer
3: left channel, this one appears to go very fast, it might be dangerous

You continue along the path
Long after the cabin fades from view you see the sun begins to set
You have left the only possible shelter behind you and you begin to fear for the end
As you continue along the path and the light of day fades you find it harder and harder to see the path ahead of you
To make matters worse, you feel a dampness in the air as rolls of fog come in
You have been in fog before but this feels different, this feels hopeless
Now wandering alone in the dark thick fog you wander meaninglessly hoping for any sign of safety
And as you hear a lowly growl behind you and its breath on your neck
You know that that is impossible to escape
finish
You turn around and you see.....it
A large man like beast, taller than you, stronger than you
It is tall and slender, and has horns sprouting from its head like a 20 point buck
Its maw of teeth coming from the snout of a wolf
The last thing you'll see is this beast, surely you wont be last thing it sees..
finish
You run as fast as you can
For each step you take in your stride you hear the footsteps behind you
The only thing you can focus on is the footsteps, as they beat in your ear you think you go mad
Seconds become minutes, minutes becomes hours as they only thing you can do is run from this unknown footsteps
With no options to protect yourself you look for anything ahead that can help you
You suddenly see some options to possibly save yourself
What do you choose?
1: Run towards the cliff ledge to climb higher to freedom and give yourself the higher ground
2: Continue running through the woods
3: Head towards the cliff ledge and jump off to the river below

It gives you none
finish
You start climbing the fence, and as you cross over you suddenly find yourself out of the forest
Now it is just you and the road
You wander on the road for what feels like hours
Finally you come accross what seems like a diner
You go in and finally see another person, all of today you have been surviving now you can finally relax
You order some food and talk to the waitress
Upon asking where you are you are told that you are in a different state then where you are from
You cannot believe that you have travelled so far and somehow was taken to or woke up in a random forest
You suddenly become tired and want to go to sleep
You know you shoudn't but the tiredness overcomes you
And you awaken, in the forest
finish
You walk along the fenceline
You are not sure why but you don't trust the road
Something about it just seems too good to be true
After awhile you have seen no cars come by
This road has no people, no anything on it
No litter, no roadkill, no construction, not even a pothole
The road is too perfect, it looks like it has never been driven on
Its too perfect, the road, all the can think about is the road, the road is all
You blink and then suddenly you are on the road, and the forest is gone
All there is is the road
You hear something coming behind you
You turn around, and suddenly you are struck by a truck, on the road
You will die on the road, forever on the road
finish
You wait and wait and wait
Nothing
You wait more and more
And still nothing
Something seems unnatural about this road
You wait and wait, until the sun goes fully down and past the fenceline you see nothing
It is too dark to see anything
You try to move through the woods to no avail
Everywhere you turn is darkness, more fences, more road, more darkness
Until you are surrounded by darkness
And it envelopes you
Until all you see and are is darkness
finish
You lay your head down on the musty old pillow and you feel some semplance of reprieve
Then you open your eyes as they wander down to the small bed in the corner
There is a small porcelain doll on the foot of the bed
Upon seeing this creepy doll staring at you, you feel the relaxation of this bed leave your body
Nontheless you go back to sleep
And upon waking up...the doll is gone
You sit up, terrified of the possibility of someone being in the cabin with you, or... no that's not possible
You get out of bed and wander around aimlessly, still surrounded by the darkness outside
You hear giggling, you turn around to possibly see what is making that noise
More giggling but behind you, you scramble to get away but in the darkness you can't make it far
Suddenly, you see a light, the fireplace goes up in flame illuminating the room around you
And you see it, the doll, sitting in front of the fireplace
More giggling, as your worst fears come true
And as the doll lifts up in the air and starts moving towards you
You realize your time is up
finish
As you are in this cabin in darkness, you try to stay awake
Realizing just how exausted you are, you feel air around you stiffen
And your breath as it leaves your nose turns into a fog, you feel a chill
You need to find a source of heat
As you gather some blankets from the bedroom you wander around the dark cabin for anything
The blankets do nothing as you see the windows freeze over
As ice envelops the cabin you huddle in the corner to try to lock off your own heat in these blankets but no matter what you do
You feel the freezing cold
Until you feel nothing at all
finish
Thankfully there is a firestarter in the main room of the cabin near the fireplace, and with some spare firewood nearby you start working on the fireplace
As you bask in the warmth of the flame, you start hearing rustling bushes outside and a low growling
You hear it get closer to the cabin
To find a makeshift weapon you take action with the one thing you have, the flames
You tear pieces of cloth off of the blankets in the bedroom, wrap it around a skinny piece of firewood, and use the fire to make a makeshift torch
As you light your torch you hear banging on the doors, much too powerful to be any animal or person
You do not know what to do
You could possibly barricade the cabin
Or take the fight out to the beast
Or simply run away
What do you do?
1: Barricade your shelter
2: Fight the beast
3: Run

As you go down the right channel, you bask in the beauty of the nearby woods along the water
You enjoy the ride as the safety of the waters fills you with acceptance that you will make it out
That safety doesn't last long, as you hear water hitting more water
But that doesn't make sense, you are looking down the stream and do not see the water level changing at all
And then it hits you
You can't see over the cliff
As you go down the waterfall you cannot believe your luck is this terrible
finish
As you go down the middle channel, you struggle to go forward along the reeds and fallen trees in this stream
You can hear old logs and branches scraping along the botton of your boat
Suddenly as you are wading your way through the engine on the boat starts sputtering and the motor fails
There must be some reeds and much stuck on the propeller
You jump in the water to get your propellor cleaned off and unstuck
And as soon as you clean off the propellor
You are pulled down to the deep and strangled by the reeds
finish
You struggle as you wade through the fast rapids
Thankfully you are in a motor boat and not a paddle boat to you have a little more control
You manage to clear through the rapids with little damage from the rocks
As you go down the river you feel a sense of freedom
You look at your map as the river calms
This river brings you out to a lake
And on the other side of that lake is a town
Civilization is on the horizon
And as you go down into the lake
You sail towards the horizon knowing you have saved yourself
Good job
finish
You reach the rock wall and you climb as fast as you can
You just reach high enough out of the creaturew reach as you reach the pinnacle of this cliff side
You wait for what appears to be hours as the sun reaches the horizon
The beast finally goes away and you feel your heart beat calm
As you look aorund from this elevated point, you see the true vastness of the forest
It goes on as far as the eye can see, the only sight that isn't covered in greenery is a neary lake connected to a much larger lake going as far as you can see
Your journey has just begun
Maybe your life now isn't about escaping, but survival
finish
You run as fast as your legs can carry you
But you are no match for the beasts speed
You do not make it far
finish
You can go higher, continue down the path, or jump off the nearest cliff edge
You choose the latter
You dive off the side of the cliff
The beast doesn't dare follow
You crash into the cold flowing river below
As you struggle to surface and catch a breath you wonder if this truly was the correct course of action
The river takes you down for miles as you struggle to stay conscious
Finally the river opens up to a channel and you pass out on the sandy beach
Upon awakening you notice you are not on any beach at all
But a bed
Your bed
You remember all that transpired but you never made it out
Yet here you are, safe and sound in your home
Was it a dream?
You go to the your bathroom mirror and rinse water over your face
And as you look up and face yourself in the mirror you see it
The sand in your hair
The sand from the beach
finish
You find whatever you can do barricade the door, chairs, a table
Anything to stop the pounding outside
You hold yourself agaisnt the barricade while the banging intensifies and becomes more frequent
Then it stops
You hear nothing
You think you are safe
Then you look up, and you are anything but safe
In front of you is a open back door, and the beast right in front of you
You don't even make it out of the room
finish
You grab your torch, and also a firepoker from the chimney, and you embark on your battle
You shove through the door, pushing the beast back
It snarls at you and almost jumps at you before you lift the torch up
It recoils in the presence of the flames
If you can scare it
You can kill it
You get closer to it and it backs away
You lower the torch and thrust at it with the firepoker
You stab its side and it lets out a horendus shreik
You step back as it swipes blindly at you
You barely make it out of the way as it barrels into the side of the cabin
You have an opportunity here
What will you do?
1: Attack
2: Make your escape
3: Stay to see what happens

You run to the back of the cabin where you find a back door, you leave as you hear the door breaking
You make it out of the house as you hear snarling and breaking objects in the house
You run as fast as you can, you hear a massive roar
You think its past the house now
Its following you
You've exausted all your options, there is just woods infront of you, and more woods behind
Even if you somehow lose the creature you will be back at square one
You run for your life as you see your past choices haunt you
Leading to this exact moment
And that is when you realize that as long as you are in these woods
This thing will hunt you
And you have nothing to help yourself with
As you slow down from tiredness
You wonder what you could have done differently
You continue to ponder that
As the beast tears you to shreds
finish
You decide to strike
As the beast is stunned you beat the beast with a barage of blows
You extend the torch towards the beast and it erupts into flames
You continue to stab at it with violent thrusts as it wriles on the ground
It stops moving, no more growls, no more snarls
It is just you in the woods
Days pass by, months
The woods give you no more trials, no more beasts or cold
But it won't let you leave
This is your life now
But you have conquered the forest
finish
Running again
How many times will you run from this beast?
How many times can you run from it?
These are the questions entering your mind as you once again flee the scene
More self doubt as you hear the howls of the beast
It is after you once again
You fear this is the first day of many in fleeing this beast
And right you were
These woods would become your home
With the beast always on your tail
On the good days you wouldn't see it at all
There were more bad days than good
You never make it out of the forest
And you never stop running
finish
You watch as the beast is stunned in pain
You are not certain why you stay
Maybe you were parylized with fear
Maybe you were just curious
The beast stands up slowly and meets your gaze
It stares at you for a minute
As if examining you
Before you can think you're tackled to the ground by the beast
And you submit to your fate
But this was not the end of your story
You wake up somewhere you do not recognize
But you're still in a forest
This one seems different somehow
You wander for what feels like days
Delerously hungry
You do manage to scrounge for food but you continue to hunger
All you know is eating and never being satisfied
Months pass by your body stiffens as you grow taller, lengthier, hungrier
Your always in agony as your skull extends, your teeth sharpen, your horns grow
Until you are the king of the forest
And any person to wander in your woods is just another meal
Another lamb for the slaughter
